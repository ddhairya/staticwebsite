# staticwebstie
A simple static website with gradient style one of my first early days part time contribution. 
It contains very basic features such as float, gradient style, header and footer, external css, link, table and etc. 
It's not the finest and code effeicient as many places inline css is been used but it will give an general idea in a simple way how to build you first site.
